`Search Questions `
1. The normal search will be going 1 by 1 where as the binary search is taking you to the middle point of the list and it checks whether the item is less then greater than or equal, this helps reduce the amount of task that is needed to be performed. 

2. binary search is more effiecent because it cuts it in half instead of looking through the entire list. 

3. When it searches through the list it starts at the first one and keeps going on until it finds it or doesn't but since our list here is 11 it would be log 11 and this would be the same for our binary code. 

`Sorting Questions` 

1. I noticed that by using the selection sorting it's very slow, however insertion is a little faster because you don't have to search through the entire sections, and finally the bubble sorting is faster the closer to perfect the arrangement is. 

2. It roughly took 45 comparisons for all three of the methods possible. so it would take roughtly around 4950 for 100 and 499500 for 1000. 

3. Out of these methods, I believe that the extra time that is needed to sort the elements would completely outweigh the benefits of binary serach, so that a normal search would be much better of a choice.
